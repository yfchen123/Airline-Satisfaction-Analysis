# Perform basic EDA to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
# Plot distributions of key features using histograms, box plots, etc.
# Visualize relationships between features and identify correlations using heatmaps.
# Discuss key insights drawn from EDA and potential challenges with the dataset (e.g., class imbalance, highly correlated features).
